/*Your error simulation code must be a completely separate program (or programs) from your client and server code. 
The error simulator communicates with the client and the server using DatagramSocket objects. 
The number of threads for this code is your choice. 
Note that it should be possible to run two or more clients as well as the server in error simulation mode.
Added May 11th: Your error simulator may be single-threaded and is expected to work with one client only. 
To test multiple clients, send directly to port 69 (until we move to multiple machines)*/
